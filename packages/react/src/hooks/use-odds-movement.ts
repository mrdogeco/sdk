/**
 * Diffs each line's price against the price it had the last time this
 * hook saw a market for the same match, so a UI can color a price green or
 * red as live odds change. Movement isn't something the SDK computes or
 * sends — `odds.subscribe` pushes a full replace-in-place snapshot on
 * every change (see `useOdds`), so this hook remembers the previous
 * snapshot's prices itself and compares. Pure diffing, no cache/store
 * involved — nothing to fetch or share here.
 *
 * A line with no prior snapshot to compare against (first time seen, or
 * the match/market just changed) has no entry in the result — nothing to
 * compare yet, not a "flat" tick. An unchanged price also has no entry,
 * on purpose: a color that never goes away would just be noise.
